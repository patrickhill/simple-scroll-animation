# TinyScroll

## Super tiny Javascript for animating elements on scroll

<img src="/media/tinyscroll.gif" alt="tinyscroll demonstration"/>

Uses requestAnimationFrame for high performance scrolling. If a browser doesn't support requestAnimationFrame, it gracefully falls back to no animations.

Javascript only 820b when compressed.

Based on Paul Lewis's Leaner, Meaner, Faster Animations with requestAnimationFrame
